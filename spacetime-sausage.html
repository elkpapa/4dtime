<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_01.png" alt="In big bubble letters, the title reads The Spacetime Sausage with a logo that looks like the front of a can of tomato sauce. Elk is hanging out of a green circle giving a thumbs up and winking, wearing a chef outfit and a big curly mustache. The logo has the colors of the Italian flag. Below this is a drawing of a tube of salami. Elk says, Let's consider the delicious Italian dried meat food, the salami. He continues: Ok, so what does sausage have to do wtih anything, you may be wondering." width="1000">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_02.png" alt="Pictured is the salami sliced down the middle to make a single slice of salami. Elk continues, think of a piece of salami. What is a piece of salami? It's a slice of meat from a larger tube of meat (a sausage). In bubble letters, it reads in Block Universe Theory, we think of the universe as a 4-dimensional block of spacetime. Any and all events, past present and future, and all matter exist in one unmoving 4-dimensional chunk. Pictured is a modified Rudy Rucker diagram fig. 146, which shows a long see-through rectangle with a red line traversing it from one end to the other. On the side of the rectangle facing the viewer is a point (the start of the segment) and the line ends with an arrow, implying it continuing at the opposite end of the rectangle." width="1000">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_03.png" alt="Next is an image of the same rectangle, but bisected into smaller slices along its length. One slice is poking out from the block, and it is emblazoned in red all-caps 'NOW'. A comment points at the 'now' slice and reads, 'now' is just a single slice of the block universe. Below we see a smiling earthworm digging in the dirt. The earthworm says, Some people call the 4D extension of an object a spacetime worm, and some four-dimensionalists affectionally call their 4D worldview the 'worm view'." width="1000">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_04.png" alt="The earthworm continues, the idea of spacetime worms has gotten some traction in popular culture: I think it's because people erroneously conflate them with wormholes. Pictured is a rendering of a still from the 2001 film Donnie Darko of the titular protagonist where a bright, liquid spear flows from his chest, looking rather worm-like. To the left of this image is a smiling see-through tube, who says, I prefer spacetime sausage because of the ease of the slicing metaphor for slices of spacetime, and because humans already are just meat tubes flying through space!" width="1000" usemap="#sausage1">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_05.png" alt="Another speech bubble appears, reading the 'meat' of the issue, philosophically speaking, is persistence through time. Our main quest here is answering the question of what it looks like for a subject to 'perdure', or, exist over a period of time. Next to this bubble we see a diagram showing on the left hand side, a Black baby with a purple pacifier then an arrow pointing to an old Black man with a really long white beard and purple pants. The diagram is labelled with a banner reading 'Perdurantism'. Another bubble continues, what does 'perduring' look like? How can we visualize a 4D subject? The spacetime sausage is a good first step." width="1000" usemap="#sausage2">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_06.png" alt="Taking up the whole frame of the web browser window, we two full-body drawings of Elk, one on each side of the screen both facing the same direction. Elk on the left says with one leg bent, so let's say at t=1 (t being time), I'm over here. On the right-hand side, the other Elk says, And by t=5, I've walked over here." width="1000">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_07.png" alt="The Elk on the left is labelled 'Elk at t=1', and the Elk on the right is labelled 'Elk at t=5'." width="1000">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_2_01.png" alt="Another Elk appears, and he looks distressed. He looks toward the viewer and asks, How dow e express that movement through spacetime? How hav epeople portrayed temporal movement before?" width="1000">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_2_02.png" alt="Then we see 5 Elks lined up with their legs overlapping giving a sensation of movement. All five Elks say in one speech bubble, 'Maybe a little something like this?' Each Elk is labelled as t=1, t=2, t=3, t=4, and t=5 respectively." width="1000">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_2_03.png" alt="Elk barges in from stage right, and says, Look familiar? He is pointing to the right at a clickable image, a painting of yellowy brown overlapping figures moving at a diagonal across the canvas. Elk continues, This is the same strategy as Cubist painter Marcel Duchamp's 'Nude Descending a Staircase #2. Overlapping figures to convey a sense of 4D movement." width="1000" usemap="#sausage3">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_2_04.png" alt="Next is pictured the same salami from earlier, but sliced up. On one side there is still an intact larger segment of the sausage, the butt end, and overlaid on the stump are dotted circles that outline potential future slices. A speech bubble reads, essentially you take some slices of spacetime sausage and juxtapose them, giving the illusion of simultaneity." width="1000" usemap="#sausage4">

Below that, we see the sliced sausage once more, with the first slice on the butt end being t=1, the next slice t=2, the next t=3, t=4, then the intact opposite sausage chunk is labelled '...and so on'." width="1000">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_2_06.png" alt="Italian Chef-Elk reappears, sporting an over-the-top facial expression denoting frustration, while also expressing his frustration with his hands. He shouts, Aspetta, Signor! Which in Italian means 'Wait, mister!' One might say this does not express the truth of la salsiccia (Italian for 'sausage'). Certamente (certainly) the slices are accurate, but something is missing! Simultaneity is not the same as unity!" width="1000">

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/SAUSAGE/spacetime-sausage_2_07.png" alt="We see Elk again, this time, eyes wide with his eyebrows raised, motioning chopping with this hands. He says, La Salsiccia has slices. BUT IT IS ALSO A WHOLE! A narration bubble reads, Rather than drawing this overlapping to imply unity, then, why not just draw the unity itself? Next we see Elk as a giant sandworm atop a brightly-lit dune. He has blue eyes and the sky is blue and cloudless. He whispers in a dotted speech bubble, I mean, that's kind of what the worm view is all about, right? Underneath Elk's bulky worm-form, it reads, 'yes this is a dune reference.' If you click on sandworm-Elk it takes you to an explanation of the reference." width="1000" usemap="#sausage5">
