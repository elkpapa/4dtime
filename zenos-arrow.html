A text box shows the source material, and says 'As recounted by Aristotle (Physics, Book VI:9, 239B5). As you scroll to the right, you see an image of me holding a bow and arrow and suited up in archery gear. I whisper, 'Please excuse me while I nock this arrow' as I am pictured placing the arrow's end on the nocking point, readying the arrow to shoot. A side comment reads, did I mention I had an archery phase??" height=585 usemap="#zeno1"

The arrow then meets a bust on a column of the philosopher, Zeno, and the column has the words 'ya boi Zeno' emblazoned on capital. Zeno's cold, gray face is slightly reflective, implying marble. He has a beard and big ears, and looks very serious." height=585></li

He says, To me it's a bit of a cheap shot, as it were. The conclusion you're supposed to reach is that either A) Time is motion, or B) Motion doesn't exist." height=585></li

He's holding up his hands in a gesture that seems to suggest thinking about the big picture. He says straight to the reader, But let's get back to the core of the issue: how long is a moment?" height=585 usemap="#zeno8"

		><li><img src="media/COMICS PAGES/ARROW/Zeno's-Arrow_09.png" alt="Another Elk appears, this time pouring a glass of red wine. The wine's pour is frozen as it enters the glass. He asks, How long is this moment? Another Elk is swinging a baseball bat, and the ball is hurtling towards it. He grunts, 'How about this one?' We then are brought to a very still image of Elk in a full-color scene where he remains in black and white. He has his chin on his hand as he is listening to music with big headphones, and he appears to be drawing a sausage with a dip pen. Behind him is a rainy window frame with a cat staring out it, seated. There's a red lamp illuminating him, as well as a small potted plant. (This image is a reference to the low-fi hip hop beats youtube channels that all use the same image as their still video that accompanies chill hiphop muzak).The image is encircled by speech bubbles that you can read either clockwise or anti-clockwise. The first bubble reads, let's think for a second... The next reads, Duration is a series of moments. The next, Thus, time (as duration) is infinitely divisible. The next, A single 'moment' can be infinitely divisible, making it functionally durationless. Along the bottom of the image, a bubble reads, Time-slice ontology doesn't tell us how long a single 'moment' endures. Then, Zeno helps us recognize the aribtrary futility of 'slicing' time. The final bubble reads, Can we draw 'durationless' instants as snapshots of the 'unity' of a spacetime sausage?" height=585 usemap="#zeno9"

		><li><img src="media/COMICS PAGES/ARROW/Zeno's-Arrow_10.png" alt="In the final pseudo-panel, we see Elk asleep just in his boxers with his belly hanging out and top surgery scars on full display, drooling unceremoniously. While his head is rested on a pillow, instead of lying on a bed he is suspended in a black and white rendition of the night sky, with myriad glimmering stars behind him, contained in a wavy panel, again surrounded by woogly speech bubbles hanging in space around him. The first reads, Drawing the unity itself seems like an impossible task. The next down reads, Humans never see continuity; we blink, we sleep, we faint. Then, counter-clockwise, How do we reconstruct 'chunks' of time? The final speech bubble reads, We can use the mind - and the eye - as guide." height=585></li
