Hello, world! My name is Elk Paauw, and I'm the creator of this comic. Of course, it wouldn't have been possible without the help of <a href="thanks.html" target="_blank">my friends and collaborators</a>.
</p>
<p>
Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, just recently moved to Chicago and yearning for the sea. Ironically, I'm related to the oft-celebrated theist <a href="http://theor.jinr.ru/~kuzemsky/plantingabio.html" target="_blank">Al Plantinga</a>, who was roommates with my grandfather at Calvin College and whom eventually married into the Paauw family. Small world, right?! My dad got his BA in Philosophy at UW, and I went on to do the same. I guess it's kind of a family affair.
</p>

I've been an avid reader my whole life, and started making comics when I was around 10 years old. My favorites as a kid were Archie comics and Sailor Moon. I started reading Nietzsche as an angsty teen, and have been philosophizing ever since. I also picked up a copy of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/71855/in-search-of-schrodingers-cat-by-john-gribbin/" target="_blank">In Search of Schrodinger's Cat</a> from my father (via my Uncle Randy) around the same time, which spawned my interest in theoretical physics and cosmology. My Uncle Randy also lent me the entire Aubrey-Maturin AKA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey%E2%80%93Maturin_series" target="_blank">Master and Commander</a> series, which has resulted in my lifelong love of tall ships and sailing. Most of my other comics, in fact, are about sailing! (See: <a href="https://www.elkpapa.com/goodmahnin" target="_blank">Good Mahnin' Yankee</a> and <a href="https://www.elkpapa.com/wish-you-were-pier" target="_blank">Wish You Were Pier</a>).
</p>
<p>
Other than that, I mostly make autobiographical comics about <a href="https://www.elkpapa.com/a-matter-of-life-and-jeff-1" target="_blank">fart jokes</a>, <a href="https://www.elkpapa.com/its-okay-to-be-sad-sometimes" target="_blank">pizza</a>, <a href="https://www.elkpapa.com/a-matter-of-life-and-jeff-2" target="_blank">depression and anxiety</a>, and <a href="https://www.elkpapa.com/coming-out-comic" target="_blank">transness</a>. I am in a band called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spookyactionart/" target="_blank">Spooky Action</a> where I do live-drawing, and we have done <a href="https://www.elkpapa.com/spooky-action/pgtup09rwo2d2p0dqwagxqs1t05dqy" target="_blank">a couple of goofy zines</a> about science-y stuff as well!
</p>
<p>
This site was made in part to fulfill my thesis requirements for the <a href="https://www.saic.edu/academics/departments/visual-and-critical-studies/graduate-overview" target="_blank">School of the Art Institute of Chicago's Visual and Critical Studies Master's program</a>. However, I would've made it regardless.
