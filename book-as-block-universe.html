With height, length, and width? To the right is a second coordinate plane, with each axis labelled. Elk continues: You can ascribe any 3 qualities to these axes, so in this case we'll use time as our third dimension. x = D1, y = D2, and z = D3. D1, dimension 1, is labelled as length. D2, dimension 2, is labelled as height. D3, dimension 3, is labelled time." width="1000">
<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_1_05.png" alt="Next we have a small rectangle with x and y axes marked. To the right of this small rectangle, it reads = plane, = panel, = frame. This is to show that the rectangle can be read in any of these ways visually/metaphorically. To the right is another coordinate plane with x, y, and z axes. The rectangle, or, plane, is evenly placed across the z axis, overlapping one another. The image to the right is just the overlapping planes sans graph, and the planes are outlined collectively inscribing the shape of a cuboid, or rectangular prism. Text boxes below these images read in sequence: So, take a few 2D planes... and juxtapose them across the Z axis, which we have now dubbed time... and you get a 2D representation of a 4D hyper-object in 3 dimensions! A block of spacetime!" width="1000">
<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_1_06.png" alt="Another bubble appears, reading: The film strip uses this same strategy to superimpose a four-dimensional experience. Again, pictured to the right of the bubble, we see a rectangle with x (height) and y (length) marked, with the whole rectangle designated as 1 frame. Next we see a film strip. Each frame is labelled with x and y on their respective axes. There are four frames pictured, the first labelled t=1, the next t=2, and so on. Below the film strip, it reads T1+T1+T3+T4=Z." width="1000">
<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_2_01.png" alt="The next narration bubble reads: Placing these 2D planes in sequence when projected adds a 3rd dimension: time.

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_2_02.png" alt="Next is pictured a reel of film, with the tail end moving towards the viewer.

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_2_03.png" alt="Each frame is a slice... We see four frames next to one another spaced evenly so as to not overlap, much like the previous shot of the laid-out film frames. A bubble reads: And together, they create a chunk of spacetime!

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_3_02.png" alt="Thierry takes over for Elk, and continues speaking with guillemet, or, french quotation marks, implying he is speaking in French. «Just how cinema has the frame of the film,» he says, gesturing a blank square labelled frame, «comics have the panel.» «The difference is that the comics frame is spread out across a page, which I have called the 'hyperframe'.» He points downward at a fascimile of a comics page littered with panels, where the outer edge of the page is labelled hyperframe. He continues: «Each frame relates to the others, and is read through the connection it has with the other images, and with the page as a whole.» These speech bubbles have all been attributed to his book as direct quotes, taken from page 111." width="1000">
<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_3_03.png" alt="Here we see Minkowski Space diagrammed once again. The present is the 0,0,0 of the x,y,z axes,which spread out over two dimensions (x and y) becomes the plane of the present. Shooting backwards on the z axis is the past light cone, shooting forwards in time is the future light cone. Elk is on the right hand of the diagram to re-introduce it to us.

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_3_05.png" alt="Just like in a film, each frame is a slice... (We see again four blank frames in sequnce) ...and together they make a block of spacetime!

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_3_06.png" alt="Thierry Groensteen intrudes, eyebrows raised. He says, MAIS-! which in French means BUT-!

<img src="media/COMICS PAGES/BLOCK/block_3_07.png" alt="Elk agrees: Yes, exactly! We see him as in Zeno's Arrow reading his bow pulling the arrow's fletching right under his cheek.
