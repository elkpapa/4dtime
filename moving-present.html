A bubble reads, as mentioned previously, in BLOCK UNIVERSE THEORY [link] every moment in the universe is crystallized in an all-inclusive chunk of spacetime known as the block universe. We see another rectangular prism, this time all sliced up like a loaf of bread into smaller cubes. One of them sticks out and is labelled NOW in big red letters." usemap="#moving2">

Another bubble continues: Minkowski space is a non-euclidian, four-dimensional manifold [link] discovered through what Minkowski calls visual-geometric intuition (page 87). Next is pictured the Minkowski Space diagram. There is a flat plane at the center of a simple x,y graph where x and y are both demarcated as 'space'. From the center (x=0, y=0) two light cones project outward on a z axis. This point is labelled 'observer'. The cone projecting into the past is labelled the past light cone, the other which projects forward, the future light cone. The flat plane on the x,y graph is labelled 'the Hypersurface of the present'." usemap="#moving5">
