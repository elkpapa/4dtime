According to the neon signs in the windows, and the crusty banner overhead, this brown building houses a watch and clock repair shop called Time Keepers.

We see a large grandfather clock in the foreground, along with a music box clock on a glass table, and in the dark back corner of the shop we see Elk, our host, wearing clocksmith goggles working on something at a dingy, messy table." width="1000">
<img src ="media/COMICS PAGES/FOURTH DIMENSION/time-keepers_1_04.png" alt="Here we see a close-up of Elk, where he is clearly working on some obscure clock part with some tiny tweezers.

<img src ="media/COMICS PAGES/FOURTH DIMENSION/time-keepers_1_05.png" alt="Elk looks up surprised, eyes amplified in size by the goggles he's wearing that enhance his vision.

<img src ="media/COMICS PAGES/FOURTH DIMENSION/time-keepers_2_02.png" alt="In the next panel, Elk jumps up abruptly, chair screeching, slamming his hands on the table like a detective about to go rogue.

<img src ="media/COMICS PAGES/FOURTH DIMENSION/hinton_1_01.png" alt="A text box reads, Western accounts of four-dimensionalism have roots in ancient greek thought. Many 19th-century four-dimensionalists cite Parmenides as their original inspiration. Pictured is a drawing of a bust of Parmenides, with the caption 5th century BCE. An arrow points at him, reading in small text, kind of a big deal. To his left we see a stone tablet that is inscribed with Greek-looking lettering. This reads, The all is one, unmoving and unchanging. The permanent amid the transient - that foothold for thought, that solid ground for feeling, on the discovery of which depends all our life - is no phantom; it is the image amidst deception of true being, the eternal, the unmoved, the one. The quote is attributed to Parmenides." width="1000" usemap="#timemap8">

The accompanying text box reads, But even before Parmenides, in the 4th century BCE, Zhuang Zhou, next to Laozi one of the fathers of daosim, conceptualized the cosmos as yu-chou, or, literally space-time!

Charles Hinton, in particular, was a big figure in the resurgence of four-dimensionalist thought in the mid-19th centure. He continues in another speech bubble, Even as a mathematician, not only did he retain the spiritual and cosmological implications of four-dimensionalism, they were central to his thinking!" width="1000" usemap="#timemap10">

<img src ="media/COMICS PAGES/FOURTH DIMENSION/hinton_2_01.png" alt="A text box reads, Hinton invented the tesseract, also known as a hypercube, a 4D cube that still titillates minds today.

<img src ="media/COMICS PAGES/FOURTH DIMENSION/hinton_2_02.png" alt="Elk appears as a rainbow tube with his head on one end and a ghostly after-image of his face on the other.

<img src ="media/COMICS PAGES/FOURTH DIMENSION/hinton_2_03.png" alt="He continues, The fourth dimension is this block of time, and consciousness is our 3-dimensional traversing of it. Pictured is a cube with a line running through it labeled you are here, circled by a squiggly line labeled whatever god's consciousness looks like. Elk continues, And our world line is suspended in the 4D block of god's consciousness, aka the cosmos." width="1000">
<img src ="media/COMICS PAGES/FOURTH DIMENSION/hinton_3_01.png" alt="Elk is lying down having a cigarette, leaning on a cube.

Now the fourth dimension is seen as some corny, esoteric magic-eye hooey sold to kids, or squawked about by astral-projecting, crystal-wearing long-hairs!
